You lean over to the table next to you and ask the two men about the lost treasure of the Shadow King.

"What do you know about it?" you ask.

The two men look at each other and then back at you.

"We've heard rumors," one of the men says. "But we don't know anything for sure."
The man hesitates for a moment before speaking.

"We've heard that the treasure is hidden in a dungeon beneath the Shadow King's castle," he says. "But it's said to be guarded by a powerful demon."
You ponder the information for a moment.

"I'm interested in learning more about this treasure," you say. "Can you tell me anything else?"
The man leans in closer and whispers, "I've also heard that the demon is said to be immune to all weapons, except for one: the Sword of Shadows."
The man shakes his head. "I don't know where you can find the Sword of Shadows," he says. "But I've heard that it is said to be hidden in a dangerous place."
The man sighs. "I'm sorry," he says. "I really don't know where the Sword of Shadows is. But if you're looking for it, I would suggest starting your search in the old library. There are said to be many ancient texts there that may contain some information about it."
The man smiles. "You're welcome," he says. "Good luck on your quest."
